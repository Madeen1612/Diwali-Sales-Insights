# Project Title: Diwali-Sales-Insights using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
# Overview:
* The Diwali Sales Analysis  is a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis [EDA] project that aims to analyze sales data during the Diwali festival season and provide valuable insights to drive business growth.
* The project combines Python for advanced data analysis techniques.
* By leveraging these tools, the project offers a holistic view of sales performance, customer behaviour, and market trends during the Diwali festival.

# Project Highlights:
* Leveraged Python for data preprocessing, cleaning, and advanced analysis tasks.

 * The raw sales data was processed using libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to ensure data quality, consistency, and accuracy for reliable analysis results.
 
* The Python code also implemented statistical analysis techniques to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers within the data.

* Conducted in-depth analysis of the sales data, including revenue analysis, product performance analysis, customer segmentation, and market trends analysis.

* The analysis revealed the top-selling products, their contribution to overall revenue, customer preferences, and buying patterns during the Diwali festival.

  # Tools and Technologies used:
 ## Python:
 * Utilized Python programming language and popular data analysis libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to perform data preprocessing, cleaning, and advanced analysis tasks.
## Notebooks: 
* Includes Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization in Python. The notebooks provide a step-by-step overview of the data analysis process, showcasing the data cleaning techniques, statistical analysis methods, and visualization approaches employed analysis.

# Project Results:
This Diwali Sales Insights EDA project ptovides valuable insights and sales performance during the Diwali festival. This analysis reveals:
* Married women age group 26-35 yrs from UP, Maharastra and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing and Electronics category.
* Overall sales trends during the Diwali season, including peak sales periods, fluctuations, and year-on-year comparisons.
* Top-selling products and their contribution to overall revenue, enabling businesses to focus on high-impact product offerings.
* Customer segmentation is based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and engagement. This segmentation helps in tailoring marketing campaigns and offers to specific customer segments.
